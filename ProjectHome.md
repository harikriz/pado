# PADO - Pattern Aligner for DNA Origami #

This MATLAB program aligns patterns on DNA origami AFM images and averages several origami images to one image. The program is useful for getting the overall average picture on the state of patterns on surface of DNA origami from an AFM scan. This is a better approach than trying to judge the state of patterns on hundreds of individual origamis.

The source code is available at the [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/pado/downloads/list) section. A pdf file describing the principles behind the working of the program has also been uploaded in the [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/pado/downloads/list) section now.

Implementation of additional features like, fully automatic recognition of origamis on an AFM scan image, precise calculation of orientation of origamis, etc., are being currently investigated. If you would like to see any other new features to be implemented, please feel free to contact me at  hkswamy@gmail.com .
